# Alura's Store Analysis 
## The First Challenge from Specialization of DataScience of Alura Latam
Welcome to our project! This is a Todo list App made in Python and edited with Google Collab.
### The Challenge

During this challenge, you will help Mr. Juan decide which store in his Alura Store chain he should sell to start a new business. The goal is to identify the least efficient store and present a final recommendation based on the data.
To do this, you will analyze data from all four stores in terms of sales volume, performance, and reviews.

* Creating data visualizations with the Matplotlib library.
* Analyzing metrics such as revenue, reviews, and sales performance.

#### The acceptance criteria are:
